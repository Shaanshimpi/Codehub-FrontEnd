INTERMEDIATE TUTORIALS (Difficulty 2):
- Assume basic programming knowledge
- Introduce more complex patterns and techniques
- Balance explanation with hands-on practice
- Include real-world problem-solving scenarios
- Connect concepts to practical applications
- Challenge students while providing adequate support

ADVANCED TUTORIALS (Difficulty 3):
- Cover sophisticated concepts and design patterns
- Assume strong programming foundation
- Focus on best practices and optimization
- Include complex real-world scenarios
- Emphasize critical thinking and analysis
- Prepare students for professional development

LESSON TYPE DISTRIBUTION:
- Include at least 1 concept lesson for foundational knowledge
- Add 1-2 interactive lessons (MCQ or fill-in-blanks) for reinforcement
- Include 1 code rearranging lesson for hands-on practice
- Balance lesson types based on topic complexity and tutorial length
- Ensure variety to maintain student engagement`
