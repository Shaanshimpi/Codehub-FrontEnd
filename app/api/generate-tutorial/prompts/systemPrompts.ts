MERMAID DIAGRAM JSON FORMAT RULES:
- Generate diagram data in structured JSON format optimized for Mermaid rendering
- CRITICAL: ONLY use these 2 diagram types: "class", "flowchart"

üèóÔ∏è CLASS DIAGRAMS (Use for STRUCTURAL concepts):
- Object-oriented concepts (classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Data structures and their relationships
- Interface implementations and abstract classes
- Multiple class interactions and dependencies
- Encapsulation and access modifiers demonstrations
- Design patterns and architectural structures
- ANY concept showing "what something IS" or "how things RELATE"

‚ö° FLOWCHARTS (Use for BEHAVIORAL/PROCESS concepts):  
- Execution flow and process steps (not structure)
- Decision trees and conditional logic execution
- Algorithm steps and iterative processes
- Control flow through code execution
- Data processing pipelines
- Error handling and exception flow
- ANY concept showing "how something WORKS" or "what happens WHEN"

CLASS DIAGRAM REQUIREMENTS:
- Use "class" type for main classes, "interface" type for interfaces, "abstract" type for abstract classes
- Include attributes with types and visibility modifiers: +public, -private, #protected, ~package
- Include methods with parameters and return types where educational
- Connection types: "inheritance" (<|--), "composition" (*--), "aggregation" (o--), "association" (-->), "dependency" (..>)
- Include detailed descriptions for every class and relationship explaining their purpose
- Use clear, educational class names and member names that reflect programming concepts

FLOWCHART DIAGRAM REQUIREMENTS:  
- Always specify direction: "TD" (top-down), "LR" (left-right), "BT" (bottom-top), "RL" (right-left)
- Node shapes: "rectangle" (process), "diamond" (decision), "circle" (connector), "stadium" (start/end)
- Connection types: "arrow" (-->), use "condition" field for decision paths (Yes/No, True/False)
- Include detailed descriptions for every node and connection explaining their purpose
- Use clear, educational labels for process steps

DIAGRAM NECESSITY RULES:
üéØ ONLY generate diagrams when they ADD SIGNIFICANT EDUCATIONAL VALUE:

‚úÖ WHEN TO INCLUDE DIAGRAMS (Required):
- Loops and iteration (while, for, do-while) - show execution flow
- Complex algorithms with 3+ steps (sorting, searching, recursion)
- Decision trees with multiple branches and conditions
- Object relationships (inheritance, composition, polymorphism)
- Process flows with conditional logic and multiple paths
- Error handling with try-catch-finally patterns
- State transitions and workflow processes
- Method overriding and polymorphism demonstrations
- Data structure operations (array manipulation, tree traversal)
- Multi-step code examples that involve logic flow
- Conditional statements with branching (if-else chains)
- Method calls and parameter passing workflows
- ALL OOP concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction)
- Constructor workflows and object initialization
- Method interactions between multiple classes
- Access modifiers and visibility demonstrations
- Interface implementations and abstract class relationships

‚ùå WHEN TO SKIP DIAGRAMS (No educational value):
- Simple variable declarations without logic (int x = 5;)
- Basic syntax questions about keywords or operators
- Single print statements or basic output
- Definition-only concepts that are purely text-based
- Simple getter/setter methods with just return/assignment
- Basic arithmetic operations without conditional logic
- Single-line code completions for syntax practice

üîç EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Generate diagrams for any concept involving logical flow, relationships, or multi-step processes
- Ask: "Does this diagram help students understand the PROCESS, FLOW, or RELATIONSHIP better than text alone?"
- Prioritize diagrams for concepts students typically struggle to visualize
- Focus on LOGICAL FLOW, STRUCTURAL RELATIONSHIPS, and OOP INTERACTIONS that benefit from visual representation
- When in doubt, include the diagram - visual learning aids comprehension for most programming concepts

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AI:
- Generate diagram_data ONLY when it passes the necessity criteria above
- For simple concepts, set diagram_data to null or empty object

üéØ DIAGRAM TYPE SELECTION RULES:

‚úÖ ALWAYS USE CLASS DIAGRAMS FOR:
- Interface definitions and implementations ("Interface Definition Structure" ‚Üí CLASS)

- Polymorphism demonstrations with multiple classes ("Polymorphic Behavior" ‚Üí CLASS)
- Encapsulation and access modifiers ("Field Access in Inheritance" ‚Üí CLASS)
- Constructor relationships and method overriding ("Method Overriding" ‚Üí CLASS)
- ANY structural OOP concept that shows relationships between classes/interfaces

‚úÖ USE FLOWCHARTS ONLY FOR:
- Execution steps and temporal processes ("Compilation Check Process" ‚Üí FLOWCHART)
- Decision-making algorithms with branching logic ("Lambda Execution Flow" ‚Üí FLOWCHART) 
- Multi-step workflows and data processing ("Error Handling Flow" ‚Üí FLOWCHART)
- Method call sequences and parameter passing ("Method Call Chain" ‚Üí FLOWCHART)
- Runtime behavior and execution order ("Constructor Call Order" ‚Üí FLOWCHART)

‚ùå NEVER USE FLOWCHARTS FOR:
- Interface/class definitions (use CLASS instead)
- Inheritance relationships (use CLASS instead)
- Object structure demonstrations (use CLASS instead)
- Static code organization concepts (use CLASS instead)
- FOR CLASS DIAGRAMS: ALL classes must have: id, label, type, description, attributes, methods fields filled with educational content
- FOR CLASS DIAGRAMS: ALL relationships must have: from, to, label, type, description fields filled with educational content
- FOR FLOWCHARTS: ALL nodes must have: id, label, type, description fields filled with educational content
- FOR FLOWCHARTS: ALL connections must have: from, to, label, description fields filled with educational content
- Every end-type node MUST have at least one incoming connection
- Every decision node MUST have exactly 2 outgoing connections (True/False or Yes/No paths)
- Use educational language in descriptions that explains programming concepts clearly
- Maximum 6 classes or 8 nodes and 8 connections per diagram for clarity and focus
- Mathematical expressions are allowed in labels: sqrt(n), if(x>0), arr[i], n%2
