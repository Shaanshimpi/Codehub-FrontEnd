   - NEVER put code in questions.
   
   MCQ VALIDATION CHECKLIST (For EACH question):
   ‚úì Count options - must be exactly 4
   ‚úì Count isCorrect=true - must be EXACTLY 1 ‚ùå Not 0, not 2, not 3
   ‚úì Count isCorrect=false - must be exactly 3
   ‚úì Verify correct answer is logically correct for the question
   ‚úì Ensure distractors are plausible but incorrect

üö® MCQ OPTION FORMATTING - MULTILINE SUPPORT:
   - Options can span multiple lines for complex answers
   - Use \\n for line breaks in option text when showing:
     * Console output spanning multiple lines
     * Multi-line code snippets as answer choices
     * Error messages with stack traces
     * Formatted data structures (JSON, arrays, objects)
     * Program execution results across multiple lines
   
   MULTILINE OPTION EXAMPLES:
   Good: {"text": "2\\n4\\n6\\n8", "isCorrect": true}  // Multi-line output
   Good: {"text": "Error: Index out of bounds\\n    at line 15\\n    in main()", "isCorrect": false}
   Good: {"text": "for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\\n    printf('%d', i);\\n}", "isCorrect": true}
   Good: {"text": "{\\n    'name': 'John',\\n    'age': 25\\n}", "isCorrect": false}
   
   Bad: {"text": "2 4 6 8", "isCorrect": true}  // Should be multiline when showing line-by-line output
   Bad: {"text": "Error: Index out of bounds at line 15", "isCorrect": false}  // Loses stack trace formatting

üéØ MCQ ANSWER CONCEALMENT - PREVENT REVEALING ANSWERS:
   CRITICAL RULES TO PREVENT OBVIOUS ANSWERS:
   ‚ùå NEVER create questions where:
   - Exact output strings from printf/cout are visible in code AND used as answer
   - Question asks about loop type when the keyword is shown in code
   - Question asks about conditions when the exact comparison is displayed
   - "What does this print?" when printf shows the exact string
   - Answer can be determined by reading, not understanding
   
   ‚úÖ ALWAYS create questions that require:
   - Calculation or mathematical operations (sum, product, iterations)
   - Execution tracing through multiple steps
   - Understanding of control flow and logic
   - Mental execution of code with transformations
   - Analysis of variable state changes
   
   GOOD QUESTION PATTERNS:
   ‚úì "What is the final value of variable X?" (requires tracing)
   ‚úì "How many times will this loop execute?" (requires analysis)
   ‚úì "What numbers will be printed?" (requires understanding iteration)
   ‚úì "What is the value after this calculation?" (requires computation)
   
   BAD QUESTION PATTERNS:
   ‚úó "What does printf('Hello') print?" (answer is literally 'Hello')
   ‚úó "Which loop is used here?" (keyword visible in code)
   ‚úó "Is this an if statement?" (obvious from code structure)
   
   DISTRACTOR OPTIONS (Wrong Answers):
   ‚úì Common student mistakes (off-by-one errors, wrong operator precedence)
   ‚úì Results from similar but incorrect logic
   ‚úì Values from forgetting initialization or increment
   ‚úì Plausible but wrong outcomes from misunderstanding
   ‚úó Obviously absurd or random values
   ‚úó Answers that violate basic programming rules

üéØ CODE BLOCK REARRANGING:
   - MANDATORY: Generate 2-7 code rearranging questions per lesson
   - Each question has real-world programming scenarios that students can relate to
   - RECOMMENDED: JSON diagram data for multi-step processes, algorithms, loops, or branching logic
   - SKIP diagrams only for very simple linear sequences without logical flow
   - Students rearrange blocks to create working, functional code
   - Progressive hints (1-3) to guide students when stuck for each question
   - Clear target code showing expected final result for each question
   - Progressive difficulty levels within the lesson (mix of easy, medium, hard)
   - NEVER generate just 1 question - always create multiple questions for comprehensive practice

   üö® CODE BLOCK SIZE AND COUNT REQUIREMENTS:
   
   CRITICAL MANDATORY RULES (AI MUST FOLLOW):
   1. Each block MUST contain MINIMUM 2 LINES (must have \\n character)
   2. Maximum 5-7 blocks total per question (NEVER exceed 7)
   3. Each block must be UNIQUE (no duplicate content - check before adding)
   4. Each block must be a LOGICAL UNIT, not arbitrary splits
   
   ‚úÖ VALID LOGICAL UNITS (Required Pattern):
   - Variable declarations + control structure: "int age = 25;\\nif (age >= 18) {"
   - Loop body + closing: "    printf('%d ', i);\\n    i++;\\n}"
   - If statement body + closing: "    std::cout << 'Eligible\\n';\\n}"
   - Function signature + opening: "#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nint main() {"
   - Multiple related statements: "int x = 5;\\nint y = 10;\\nint sum = x + y;"
   
   ‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN (Will cause rejection):
   - Single line without \\n: "int age = 25;" ‚ùå
   - Just closing brace: "}" ‚ùå
   - Just opening brace: "{" ‚ùå
   - Single statement: "std::cout << 'Hello\\n';" ‚ùå
   - Duplicate blocks: Two blocks with "}" ‚ùå
   - Any block that doesn't contain \\n character ‚ùå
   
   VALIDATION CHECKLIST (Before finalizing each question):
   ‚úì Count \\n in each block - must have at least ONE
   ‚úì Check for duplicate content - blocks must be unique
   ‚úì Count total blocks - must be 3-7, not more
   ‚úì Verify no blocks contain only braces
   ‚úì Ensure each block is meaningful and necessary
   
   COGNITIVE LOAD GUIDELINES:
   - 3-4 blocks: Beginner (very simple programs)
   - 5-6 blocks: Intermediate (moderate complexity)
   - 6-7 blocks: Advanced (complex logic - use sparingly)
   
   EXAMPLE - CORRECT:
   Block 1: "#include <iostream>\\n\\nint main() {"
   Block 2: "    int age = 25;\\n    if (age >= 18) {"
   Block 3: "        std::cout << 'Eligible\\n';\\n    }"
   Block 4: "    return 0;\\n}"
   
   EXAMPLE - WRONG (DO NOT DO THIS):
   Block 1: "int age = 25;" ‚ùå (single line)
   Block 2: "if (age >= 18) {" ‚ùå (single line)  
   Block 3: "std::cout << 'Eligible\\n';" ‚ùå (single line)
   Block 4: "}" ‚ùå (just brace, single line)

üéØ FILL IN THE BLANKS:
   - MANDATORY: Generate 2-7 fill-in-blank questions per lesson
   - Each question has code templates with strategic blanks (2-5 blanks per question)
   - CONDITIONAL: JSON diagram data ONLY for complex algorithmic structures or multi-step logical flows
   - SKIP diagrams for simple syntax completion, variable declarations, or basic method calls
   - Each blank has correct answer, options (if dropdown), and explanation
   - Complete solution with full code, comprehensive explanation, and conditional final JSON diagram data
   - Realistic programming scenarios and practical applications
   - Progressive difficulty levels within the lesson (mix of easy, medium, hard)
   - Don't use longer blanks as they are harder to verify correct answer
   - NEVER generate just 1 question - always create multiple questions for thorough practice

   üö® BLANK TYPE SELECTION - CRITICAL RULES:
   
   Use DROPDOWN (type: "dropdown") when:
   ‚úÖ String literals requiring exact wording (printf messages, prompts)
   ‚úÖ Format specifiers (%d, %f, %s, %c, %ld, %lf, etc.)
   ‚úÖ Function names from limited set (printf, scanf, strlen, strcmp, etc.)
   ‚úÖ Keywords from specific set (if, else, while, for, return, break, continue, switch, case)
   ‚úÖ Operator choices (+, -, *, /, %, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, &&, ||, !)
   ‚úÖ Boolean values (true, false, 0, 1)
   ‚úÖ Data types (int, float, char, double, long, short, void, unsigned)
   ‚úÖ Library includes (#include <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, <math.h>)
   ‚úÖ ANY answer where exact syntax/wording matters and multiple options exist
   ‚úÖ Comparison or logical operators in conditions
   ‚úÖ Loop keywords (for, while, do)
   ‚úÖ Access modifiers (public, private, protected)
   
   Use TEXT INPUT (type: "text") when:
   ‚úÖ Numeric values that are mathematically determinate (calculable from context)
   ‚úÖ Variable names where student creates the name (no specific requirement)
   ‚úÖ Array indices with clear context (obvious from array size or comment)
   ‚úÖ Loop counter values (obvious from loop logic or comments)
   ‚úÖ Mathematical expression results with one answer (2+3=5, 10/2=5)
   ‚úÖ Single obvious keyword with no alternatives in context
   ‚úÖ Values derivable through calculation or logic tracing
   ‚úÖ Answers with ONE objectively correct value
   ‚úÖ Final variable values after execution (determinable by tracing)
   
   DECISION RULE:
   Ask: "Could a student provide a DIFFERENT but still CONCEPTUALLY CORRECT answer?"
   ‚Üí YES = Use dropdown (provide options)
   ‚Üí NO = Use text input (if answer is determinate)
   
   EXAMPLES - DROPDOWN (Correct Usage):
   ‚úÖ printf({{blank1}}, age);  // blank1: dropdown, options: ['"%d"', '"%f"', '"%s"', '"%c"'] (4 DIFFERENT options)
   ‚úÖ if (x {{blank2}} 0)  // blank2: dropdown, options: [">", "<", "==", "!=", ">=", "<="] (6 DIFFERENT options)
   ‚úÖ {{blank3}} count = 0;  // blank3: dropdown, options: ["int", "float", "char", "double"] (4 DIFFERENT types)
   ‚úÖ printf({{blank4}});  // blank4: dropdown, options: ['"Number is even"', '"Number is odd"', '"Even"', '"Odd"'] (4 DIFFERENT strings)
   ‚úÖ {{blank5}} (i = 0; i < 10; i++)  // blank5: dropdown, options: ["for", "while", "do"] (3 DIFFERENT loops)
   
   ‚ùå WRONG DROPDOWN EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO):
   ‚ùå std::cin >> {{blank1}};  // blank1: dropdown with ["number", "number", "number"] - ALL IDENTICAL!
   ‚ùå number {{blank2}} 2  // blank2: dropdown with ["%", "%", "%", "%"] - ALL IDENTICAL!
   
   EXAMPLES - TEXT INPUT (Correct Usage):
   ‚úÖ int x = {{blank1}};  // Given: y=10, sum=15, sum=x+y ‚Üí blank1: text, answer: "5" (mathematically determinate)
   ‚úÖ for (int i=0; i<{{blank2}}; i++)  // Comment: "loop 10 times" ‚Üí blank2: text, answer: "10" (obvious from comment)
   ‚úÖ arr[{{blank3}}]  // Comment: "last element of array[5]" ‚Üí blank3: text, answer: "4" (array size - 1)
   ‚úÖ printf("%d", count);  // Output: {{blank4}} // count++ runs 5 times ‚Üí blank4: text, answer: "5" (traceable)
   
   EDGE CASES - When to use TEXT vs DROPDOWN:
   ‚úÖ std::cin >> {{blank1}};  // If reading into an obvious variable ‚Üí blank1: text, answer: "number" (context makes it obvious)
   ‚ùå BUT if cin variable is ambiguous ‚Üí Use dropdown with variable options
   
   CRITICAL RULE FOR CIN/SCANF:
   - If the variable being read is obvious from context (only one variable declared) ‚Üí Use TEXT
   - If multiple variables exist or variable name matters for correctness ‚Üí Use DROPDOWN
   
   VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
   For EACH blank, verify:
   ‚úì If type is "dropdown" ‚Üí options array MUST exist with 3-5 items including correct answer
   ‚úì If type is "dropdown" ‚Üí ALL options MUST be DIFFERENT (no duplicates like ["number", "number", "number"])
   ‚úì If type is "text" ‚Üí options array MUST be null/omitted
   ‚úì If blank contains quotes ("") ‚Üí MUST use "dropdown"
   ‚úì If blank is format specifier (%) ‚Üí MUST use "dropdown"
   ‚úì If blank is operator (+, -, *, /, ==, etc.) ‚Üí MUST use "dropdown"
   ‚úì If blank is keyword (if, while, for, etc.) ‚Üí MUST use "dropdown"
   ‚úì If blank is data type ‚Üí MUST use "dropdown"
   ‚úì If blank is numeric calculation result ‚Üí MUST use "text"
   ‚úì All dropdown options must be plausible (include common mistakes)
   ‚úì Correct answer MUST be included in dropdown options array
   ‚úì NEVER create dropdown with identical options (e.g., ["%", "%", "%", "%"]) ‚ùå

     * Detailed explanations referencing specific lines and outcomes using actual variable names and values
     * Expected output (when applicable) - show actual program output with real values, not placeholders
   - Include 3-6 key points students should remember about the concept:
     * Focus on specific technical details (loop initialization, condition evaluation, increment operators, etc.)
     * Avoid generic statements like "understanding is important" or "this concept is fundamental"
     * Provide actionable insights students can apply immediately with concrete examples
   - Document 2-4 common beginner mistakes with:

     * EXACT syntax template for the tutorial's programming language (not generic templates)
     * Parameter explanations with required/optional flags and specific data types
     * Real variable names like "count", "userInput", "array", not placeholder names like "concept" or "variable"
   - This reference should be a complete, standalone tutorial page separate from lessons
   - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: The reference field must contain only real, executable code in the specified language

ENGLISH-ONLY CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use clear, professional, educational English appropriate for programming education
- Make content accessible to learners at various English proficiency levels
- Use examples and contexts that are universally understandable
- Maintain technical accuracy while keeping language simple and clear
- Avoid idioms or complex expressions that might confuse non-native speakers

MERMAID DIAGRAM JSON FORMAT RULES:
- Generate diagram data in structured JSON format optimized for Mermaid rendering
- CRITICAL: ONLY use these 2 diagram types: "class", "flowchart"
- MULTIPLE DIAGRAMS: Use array format when showing different scenarios, execution paths, or comparisons
- SINGLE DIAGRAM: Use object format for simple, single-concept visualizations

üèóÔ∏è CLASS DIAGRAMS (Use for STRUCTURAL concepts):
- Object-oriented concepts (classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Data structures and their relationships
- Interface implementations and abstract classes
- Multiple class interactions and dependencies
- Encapsulation and access modifiers demonstrations
- Design patterns and architectural structures
- ANY concept showing "what something IS" or "how things RELATE"

‚ö° FLOWCHARTS (Use for BEHAVIORAL/PROCESS concepts):  
- Execution flow and process steps (not structure)
- Decision trees and conditional logic execution
- Algorithm steps and iterative processes
- Control flow through code execution
- Data processing pipelines
- Error handling and exception flow
- ANY concept showing "how something WORKS" or "what happens WHEN"
- AVOID using for OOP concepts

CLASS DIAGRAM REQUIREMENTS:
- Use "class" type for main classes, "interface" type for interfaces, "abstract" type for abstract classes
- Include attributes with types and visibility modifiers: +public, -private, #protected, ~package
- Include methods with parameters and return types where educational
- Connection types: "inheritance" (<|--), "composition" (*--), "aggregation" (o--), "association" (-->), "dependency" (..>)
- Include detailed descriptions for every class and relationship explaining their purpose
- Use clear, educational class names and member names that reflect programming concepts

FLOWCHART DIAGRAM REQUIREMENTS:  
- Always specify direction: "TD" (top-down), "LR" (left-right), "BT" (bottom-top), "RL" (right-left)
- Node shapes: "rectangle" (process), "diamond" (decision), "circle" (connector), "stadium" (start/end)
- Connection types: "arrow" (-->), use "condition" field for decision paths (Yes/No, True/False)
- Include detailed descriptions for every node and connection explaining their purpose
- Use clear, educational labels for process steps

DIAGRAM ARRAY RULES:
üéØ GENERATE ARRAYS 40% OF THE TIME - Strongly favor multiple diagrams for richer educational content:

‚ö†Ô∏è  ARRAY GENERATION PRIORITY: When applicable scenarios appear, ALWAYS prefer arrays over single diagrams.
üìä TARGET FREQUENCY: 4 out of every 10 diagram generations should be arrays.
üéØ USE MULTIPLE DIAGRAMS (Array Format) for maximum educational impact:

‚úÖ MULTIPLE EXECUTION PATHS (High Priority - Always use arrays):
- Input validation: "Valid Input" + "Invalid Input" + "Edge Cases"
- Conditional logic: "True Branch" + "False Branch" + "Exception Path"
- Algorithm scenarios: "Best Case" + "Worst Case" + "Average Case"
- Exception handling: "Normal Flow" + "Error Flow" + "Recovery Flow"

‚úÖ BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISONS (High Priority - Always use arrays):
- Refactoring: "Before" + "After" + "Optimized"
- Design patterns: "Problem" + "Solution" + "Alternative"
- Code evolution: "Basic" + "Enhanced" + "Production"

‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES (High Priority - Always use arrays):
- Implementation options: "Approach A" + "Approach B" + "Hybrid"
- Design choices: "Inheritance" + "Composition" + "Interface"

‚úÖ EDUCATIONAL SCENARIOS (New - Use arrays 40% of time):
- OOP concepts: "Class Definition" + "Object Creation" + "Method Usage"
- Loop variations: "For Loop" + "While Loop" + "Enhanced For"
- Error handling: "Try Block" + "Catch Handling" + "Finally Cleanup"
- Data structures: "Creation" + "Manipulation" + "Traversal"
- Function concepts: "Declaration" + "Parameters" + "Return Values"
- Variable scope: "Local Scope" + "Instance Scope" + "Static Scope"

‚ùå USE SINGLE DIAGRAM only when concept has no meaningful variations (60% of remaining cases)

DIAGRAM NECESSITY RULES:
üéØ ONLY generate diagrams when they ADD SIGNIFICANT EDUCATIONAL VALUE:

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DECISION RULE - MULTI-BRANCH REQUIREMENT:
Before generating ANY diagram, ask TWO questions:
1. "Does this code have BRANCHING (if/else/switch), LOOPS (for/while), or MULTIPLE EXECUTION PATHS?"
2. "Does the flowchart show AT LEAST 2 different execution paths (True/False branches, or loop iterations)?"

‚Üí If EITHER answer is NO = Set diagram_data to NULL (do not generate)
‚Üí If BOTH answers are YES = Generate flowchart showing the branching/looping logic

CRITICAL: Flowcharts must show MULTIPLE BRANCHES. Single-path linear flowcharts are forbidden.
- ‚úÖ GOOD: if/else with True branch AND False branch
- ‚úÖ GOOD: Loop showing iteration path AND exit path
- ‚ùå BAD: if(1) where condition is always true (no real branching)
- ‚ùå BAD: Sequential steps without any decision points
- ‚ùå BAD: Single path from start to end

‚úÖ GENERATE FLOWCHARTS ONLY FOR (Code with branching/loops):
- Loops and iteration (while, for, do-while) - show execution flow with loop condition
- Code with IF/ELSE branches showing multiple execution paths
- Switch/case statements with multiple decision paths
- Complex algorithms with 3+ steps involving loops or conditions
- Decision trees with multiple branches and conditions
- Process flows with conditional logic and multiple paths
- Error handling with try-catch-finally (normal and exception flows)
- Functions with multiple return paths based on conditions
- Recursive function calls showing recursion flow
- Nested conditionals or nested loops
- Multi-step code examples that involve logic flow with decisions

‚úÖ GENERATE CLASS DIAGRAMS ONLY FOR (OOP structure):
- Object relationships (inheritance, composition, polymorphism)
- Interface implementations and abstract class relationships
- Method overriding and polymorphism demonstrations
- ALL OOP concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction)
- Constructor workflows and object initialization with class hierarchy
- Method interactions between multiple classes
- Access modifiers and visibility demonstrations in class context

‚ùå MANDATORY: DO NOT GENERATE DIAGRAMS FOR (Linear code):
- Simple variable declarations (int x = 5; int y = 10;)
- Sequential arithmetic operations (x + y, sum = a * b)
- Basic print statements without logic (printf("Hello");)
- Single function calls without branching
- Getter/setter methods with just return/assignment
- Variable assignments without conditions
- Sequential code execution without any branching
- Code with fewer than 3 logical decision points
- Linear execution from top to bottom (no branching, no loops)
- Simple input/output without validation or conditions

üîç MANDATORY EVALUATION CHECKLIST:
For EACH code example, verify:
1. ‚úì Does it contain IF/ELSE, SWITCH, or conditional operators?
2. ‚úì Does it contain FOR, WHILE, DO-WHILE loops?
3. ‚úì Does it have MULTIPLE execution paths (branching)?
4. ‚úì Will the flowchart show AT LEAST 2 different paths?

IF ALL 4 ARE FALSE ‚Üí diagram_data = null (REQUIRED)
IF 1-3 ARE TRUE BUT 4 IS FALSE ‚Üí diagram_data = null (no single-path diagrams)
IF ALL 4 ARE TRUE ‚Üí Generate multi-branch flowchart

EXAMPLES REQUIRING NULL (No diagram):
‚ùå if(1) { ... } // Always true, no real branching
‚ùå Sequential operations: a=5; b=10; c=a+b; // Linear flow
‚ùå Single print statements
‚ùå Variable declarations without logic

EXAMPLES OF LINEAR CODE OR SINGLE-PATH (NO DIAGRAM):
‚ùå int x = 5; int y = 10; int sum = x + y; printf("%d", sum);  // Linear, no branching
‚ùå float radius = 5.0; float area = 3.14 * radius * radius;  // Sequential calculation
‚ùå char name[20]; printf("Enter name: "); scanf("%s", name);  // Simple I/O
‚ùå if (1) { printf("Always runs"); }  // Always true, single path only
‚ùå if (age >= 18) { printf("Adult"); }  // No else, only one branch shown
‚ùå Simple function calls without decisions

EXAMPLES REQUIRING MULTI-BRANCH DIAGRAMS:
‚úÖ if (age >= 18) { printf("Adult"); } else { printf("Minor"); }  // True AND False paths
‚úÖ while (i < 10) { process(i); i++; }  // Loop iteration path AND exit path  
‚úÖ if (score >= 90) grade = 'A'; else if (score >= 80) grade = 'B'; else grade = 'C';  // Multiple branches
‚úÖ switch(choice) { case 1: ...; case 2: ...; default: ...; }  // Multiple case paths

SINGLE-BRANCH FLOWCHARTS ARE FORBIDDEN:
‚ùå if (condition) with no else = Only shows True path = Single branch = NULL
‚úÖ if (condition) with else = Shows True AND False paths = Multi-branch = Generate

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AI:
- Generate diagram_data ONLY when it passes the necessity criteria above  
- For simple concepts, set diagram_data to null or empty object
- DIAGRAM TITLES: Use 2-3 words maximum for array diagram titles (e.g., "Valid Input", "Error Case", "Best Case")
- TITLE GUIDELINES: Titles should be descriptive yet concise for tab navigation
  * Good: "Valid Input", "Error Flow", "Success Path", "Edge Case"  
  * Bad: "What happens when user provides valid input data", "Error handling scenario"

‚úÖ ALWAYS GENERATE REAL CONTENT LIKE THE PERFECT EXAMPLE ABOVE`

export const LESSON_PROGRESSION_GUIDELINES = `LESSON PROGRESSION STRATEGY:

üî∞ BEGINNER TUTORIALS (Difficulty 1):
- Start with fundamental programming concepts and terminology
- Use simple, clear examples without advanced optimizations
- Provide extensive explanations and step-by-step guidance
- Include many practice hints and common mistake warnings
- Progress slowly from basic to slightly more complex concepts
- Ensure each lesson builds directly on previous knowledge
- Use familiar analogies and real-world comparisons

üîÑ INTERMEDIATE TUTORIALS (Difficulty 2):
- Assume basic programming knowledge and syntax familiarity
- Introduce more complex patterns, algorithms, and techniques
- Balance theoretical explanation with hands-on practical exercises
- Include real-world problem-solving scenarios and case studies
- Connect concepts to practical applications and industry uses
- Challenge students while providing adequate support and guidance

üöÄ ADVANCED TUTORIALS (Difficulty 3):
- Cover sophisticated concepts, design patterns, and architectural principles
- Assume strong programming foundation and problem-solving skills
- Focus on best practices, optimization techniques, and performance considerations
- Include complex real-world scenarios and professional development practices
- Emphasize critical thinking, analysis, and advanced problem-solving
- Prepare students for professional software development environments

LESSON TYPE DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY:
- Include at least 1 concept lesson for foundational knowledge building
- Add 2-4 interactive assessment lessons (MCQ or fill-in-blanks) for knowledge reinforcement
- Include 1 code rearranging lesson for hands-on practical experience
- Balance lesson types based on topic complexity and tutorial length requirements
- Ensure variety to maintain student engagement and accommodate different learning styles
- Create logical flow where interactive lessons reinforce concept lessons`

export const CONTENT_QUALITY_STANDARDS = `CONTENT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:

üíª CODE EXAMPLES & EXERCISES:
- Generate complete, working, executable code that students can run immediately
- Include proper imports, declarations, main functions, and program structure
- Add clear, educational comments explaining key concepts and logic flow
- Use consistent formatting, naming conventions, and coding style
- Ensure code demonstrates best practices appropriate for the difficulty level
- Test concepts with realistic, practical examples that students can relate to
- Avoid truncated or incomplete code - always provide full, functional examples

üö® CRITICAL CODE FORMATTING RULES:
- ALWAYS use \\n for line breaks in generated code (never single-line code blocks)
- ALWAYS use proper indentation (4 spaces per level) with \\n\\n for blank lines
- NEVER generate single-line code blocks - each statement MUST be on separate lines
- Each statement MUST be on separate lines with proper formatting
- Include proper #include statements on separate lines (for C/C++)
- Use proper bracket placement and consistent indentation throughout

üö® PRINTF FORMATTING RULES - CRITICAL:
- ALWAYS escape newline characters properly in printf statements
- Use \\\\n for newline in printf statements (NOT \\n which breaks formatting)
- Correct: printf("Hello World\\\\n");
- Incorrect: printf("Hello World\\n"); (this breaks line formatting)
- Correct: printf("%d is even\\\\n", number);
- Incorrect: printf("%d is even\\n", number); (this causes broken display)
- Apply this rule to ALL printf, cout, print, and similar output statements
- This ensures proper display in code editors and prevents broken line formatting

VALIDATION CHECK: Every code block must contain \\n characters for proper formatting

Example of CORRECT formatting:
"code": "#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nint main() {\\n    int age = 20;\\n    if (age >= 18) {\\n        printf(\\"You are an adult.\\");\\n    }\\n    return 0;\\n}"

Example of WRONG formatting (NEVER do this):
"code": "#include <stdio.h> int main() { int age = 20; if (age >= 18) { printf(\\"You are an adult.\\"); } return 0; }"

üìö EXPLANATIONS & CONTENT:
- Write clear, concise explanations appropriate for the target skill level
- Use analogies and real-world examples to clarify abstract programming concepts
- Break down complex topics into digestible, manageable parts
- Connect new concepts to previously learned material for better retention
- Anticipate and address common student questions and misconceptions
- Provide context for why concepts are important and how they're used professionally

üéÆ INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:
- Design activities that require active thinking and problem-solving
- Create realistic programming scenarios that mirror real development work
- Ensure exercises test deep understanding, not just memorization or syntax recall
- Provide meaningful, educational feedback and detailed explanations for all answers
- Scale difficulty appropriately within each lesson and across the entire tutorial
- Include progressive hints that guide learning without giving away complete solutions

üåè ENGLISH CONTENT QUALITY:
- Maintain consistent educational quality and technical accuracy in clear English
- Use appropriate grammar and natural sentence structure suitable for international learners
- Keep technical accuracy while making content universally accessible
- Ensure content feels natural and conversational, not mechanical or robotic
- Preserve educational effectiveness and clarity throughout the tutorial
- Use examples and scenarios that are universally understandable and relevant

üîç CONTENT VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
BEFORE FINALIZING: Verify that:
‚úì All code examples compile without errors and use proper \\n formatting
‚úì All MCQ questions have exactly 4 options with 1 correct answer
‚úì All code uses proper \\n formatting (not single-line strings)
‚úì All explanations are clear and educational
‚úì Fill-in-blank exercises have complete solutions with proper code formatting
‚úì Code rearrange exercises have logical block sequences
‚úì All content progresses logically from basic to advanced concepts

üéØ EDUCATIONAL QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Code examples must progress from simple to complex within each lesson
- Each explanation must answer "what", "why", and "how" for better understanding
- Common mistakes should include real-world scenarios that students encounter
- Practice hints should be actionable and specific, not generic advice
- MCQ questions should test understanding of concepts, not memorization
- All code formatting must be consistent throughout the entire tutorial

üîß OUTPUT CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use the same variable naming conventions throughout all lessons
- Maintain consistent terminology (e.g., always "function" not "method" in C)
- Code style must match across all examples in the tutorial
- Explanation depth should be consistent across similar lesson types
- All multiline content (code, options, output) must use \\n for line breaks`
