      "type": "concept",
      "content": {
        "explanation": "Variables are named storage locations in a program that hold data. They act as placeholders for values and allow developers to work with data dynamically. In Python, variables do not require explicit declaration of type, as Python is dynamically typed.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Variables store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program.",
          "Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify the data type when declaring a variable.",
          "Variable names should follow Python's naming conventions and should not conflict with reserved keywords.",
          "Variables can store different data types such as numbers, strings, lists, etc.",
          "The value of a variable can be updated at any time during the program."

            "explanation": "In this example, we declare three variables: `name` (a string), `age` (an integer), and `is_student` (a boolean). We then print their values using the `print()` function.",

            "explanation": "Here, the variable `counter` is first assigned the value `10`. Later, it is updated by adding `5` to its current value. This demonstrates how variable values can change during a program.",
            "mermaid_diagram": "flowchart TD\n    A[Start] --> B[Initialize counter = 10]\n    B --> C[Print Initial Value]\n    C --> D[Update counter]\n    D --> E[Print Updated Value]\n    E --> F[End]"

            "explanation": "Python allows reassignment of variables to different data types. In this example, `data` is first assigned an integer and later reassigned a string.",
