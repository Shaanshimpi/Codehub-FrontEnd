      "content": {
        "explanation": "Variables in Python are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated later. They act as containers for values, allowing programs to become dynamic and interactive. In Python, variables do not require explicit declaration of type; the type is inferred from the value assigned.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Variables are used to store data values in a program.",
          "Python is dynamically typed, so variables do not require explicit type declarations.",
          "Variable names must start with a letter or underscore and can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.",
          "Python is case-sensitive, so variable names like 'myVariable' and 'MyVariable' are different."

            "explanation": "This example demonstrates how to define variables of different data types (string, integer, and float) and print their values. The variables 'name', 'age', and 'height' are assigned values directly.",

            "explanation": "Variables can be reassigned to hold new values. In this example, the variable 'x' is first assigned the value 10, then reassigned to 20. The variable 'y' is assigned a value based on the initial value of 'x'.",
